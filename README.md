# SRG-Zoo-Networks

This repository contains the networks and plots from the SRG-Zoo project. 

These netoworks are not finalized and are still work in progress! They are sourced from the Internet Topology Zoo and the SND library of networks, with some adjustments made in order to unify network format and resolve eventual problems, such as missing coordinates, duplicate nodes, etc. Two test networks are also included, that focus on global extreme coordinate testing.

The plots are only for visualization purposes!
